            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Santiago Suarez Narvaez, I am an international student from <em>Colombia</em>, where I used to live with my mother called Iveth, my sister called Carol, my dog called Candy, and my cat called Ella. This year I am turning 24 years old on the 7<sup>th</sup> April and I am currently starting first semester of Interactive media design. </p>
            
            <p>I consider myself an easygoing person, talkative and passionate person. I have a bunch of interests such as filmmaking, animation, and design; overall I can say I am very into arts. Apart from that I like to do sports, go to the gym, and play some music in my free time. I have a background studying audiovisual media emphasizing photography and filmmaking. I actually working in build my production business with my team in Colombia called <abbr title="Elegang Productions">E.P.</abbr>, hoping someday work with them here in Canada.</p>
